### Install Jenkins.

Pre-Requisites:
 - Java (JDK)

### Install Java and Jenkins

Install Java

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre
```

Verify, if Java is Installed

```
java -version

```

Now, proceed with installing Jenkins

```
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io-2023.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins
```

**Note: ** By default, Jenkins will not be accessible to the external world due to the inbound traffic restriction by AWS. Open port 8080 in the inbound traffic rules.

- Added inbound traffic rules as shown in the image (In my case, I allowed `All traffic`).
